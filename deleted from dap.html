"I would like to know if you could help me describe what kind of Steinway I have (year/make/model) and what type of work you did on it, which ultimately made it the most beautiful Steinway I ever played. I believe you replaced some strings and maybe even did some weighting of the keys? The careful work you did on it is very important in regard to the piano because that made all the difference to me. I even plan to mention your name as the caretaker of the piano, as part of how special this piano really is."
